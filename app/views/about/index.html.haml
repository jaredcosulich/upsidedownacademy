%p Upside Down Academy is a work in progress. It was created by <a href='http://puzzleschool.com'>The Puzzle School</a>.

  At it's heart Upside Down Academy is about making it easier
  for students to help each other learn through a creative, open-ended process.

%p
  The site is designed to make it easy to turn any lesson in to puzzle-based learning. 
  By creating lessons to teach their peers, students do creative work that allows for autonomy (they can approach
  the video how ever they want), requires developing strategies, learning from failure, and iterating in order
  to get their video right, and, in creating a video that others can learn from, has a true benefit beyond just a grade.

  , a great way to help students challenge and increase their understanding of the material. 
  Students are creating lessons that they can refer back to later on
  and that accumulate in to a wealth of "peer-tutoring" resources that can be used by all
  students and teachers as great supplemental material for learning.
